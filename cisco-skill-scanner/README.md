[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner)

A best-effort security scanner for AI Agent Skills that detects prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious code patterns. Combines **pattern-based detection** (YAML + YARA), **LLM-as-a-judge**, and **behavioral dataflow analysis** to maximize detection coverage of probable threats while minimizing false positives.

> **Important:** This scanner provides best-effort detection, not comprehensive or complete coverage. A scan that returns no findings does not guarantee that a skill is free of all threats. See [Scope and Limitations](#scope-and-limitations) below.

Supports [OpenAI Codex Skills](https://openai.github.io/codex/) and [Cursor Agent Skills](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) formats following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io).

## Highlights

- **Multi-Engine Detection** - Static analysis, behavioral dataflow, LLM semantic analysis, and cloud-based scanning for layered, best-effort coverage
- **False Positive Filtering** - Meta-analyzer significantly reduces noise while preserving detection capability
- **CI/CD Ready** - SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning, [reusable GitHub Actions workflow](docs/github-actions.md), exit codes for build failures
- **Pre-commit Hook** - [Standard pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) integration to scan skills before every commit
- **Extensible** - Plugin architecture for custom analyzers

## Scope and Limitations

Skill Scanner is a detection tool. It identifies known and probable risk patterns, but it does not certify security.

**Key limitations:**

- **No findings ≠ no risk.** A scan that returns "No findings" indicates that no known threat patterns were detected. It does not guarantee that a skill is secure, benign, or free of vulnerabilities.
- **Coverage is inherently incomplete.** The scanner combines signature-based detection, LLM-based semantic analysis, behavioral dataflow analysis, optional cloud services, and configurable rule packs. While this approach improve coverage, no automated tool can detect every technique, especially novel or zero-day attacks.
- **False positives and false negatives can occur.** Consensus modes and meta-analysis reduce noise, but no configuration eliminates all incorrect classifications. Tune the [scan policy](docs/user-guide/custom-policy-configuration.md) to your risk tolerance.
- **Human review remains essential.** Automated scanning is one component of a defense-in-depth strategy. High-risk or production deployments should pair scanner results with manual code review and/or  threat modeling.

</details>

---

## Quick Start

### Environment Setup (Optional)

```bash
# For LLM analyzer and Meta-analyzer
export SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

# For VirusTotal binary scanning
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="your_virustotal_api_key"

# For Cisco AI Defense
export AI_DEFENSE_API_KEY="your_aidefense_api_key"
```

### Interactive Wizard

Not sure which flags to use? Run `skill-scanner` with no arguments to launch the interactive wizard:

```bash
skill-scanner
```

The wizard walks you through selecting a scan target, analyzers, policy, and output format, then shows the assembled command before running it. Great for learning the CLI.

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Scan a single skill (core analyzers: static + bytecode + pipeline)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill

# Scan with behavioral analyzer (dataflow analysis)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral

# Scan with all engines
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral --use-llm --use-aidefense

# Scan with meta-analyzer for false positive filtering
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --enable-meta

# Scan with trigger analyzer for vague description checks
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-trigger

# Run LLM analyzer multiple times and keep majority-agreed findings
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --llm-consensus-runs 3

# Scan multiple skills recursively
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --use-behavioral

# Scan multiple skills with cross-skill overlap detection
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --check-overlap

# Lenient mode: tolerate malformed skills instead of failing
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --lenient
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --lenient

# CI/CD: Fail build if threats found
skill-scanner scan-all ./skills --fail-on-severity high --format sarif --output results.sarif

# Generate interactive HTML report with attack correlation groups
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --enable-meta --format html --output report.html

# Use custom YARA rules
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --custom-rules /path/to/my-rules/

# Use custom taxonomy + threat mapping profiles (JSON/YAML)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --taxonomy /path/to/taxonomy.json --threat-mapping /path/to/threat_mapping.json

# VirusTotal hash scan with optional unknown-file uploads
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-virustotal --vt-upload-files

# Use a scan policy preset (strict, balanced, permissive)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --policy strict

# Use a custom org policy file
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --policy my_org_policy.yaml

# Generate a policy file to customise
skill-scanner generate-policy -o my_org_policy.yaml

# Interactive policy configurator (TUI)
skill-scanner configure-policy
```

**LLM provider note:** `--llm-provider` currently accepts `anthropic` or `openai`.
For Bedrock, Vertex, Azure, Gemini, and other LiteLLM backends, set provider-specific model strings and environment variables (see [LLM Analyzer docs](docs/architecture/analyzers/llm-analyzer.md)).

### Python SDK

```python
from skill_scanner import SkillScanner
from skill_scanner.core.analyzers import BehavioralAnalyzer

# Create scanner with analyzers
scanner = SkillScanner(analyzers=[
    BehavioralAnalyzer(),
])

# Scan a skill
result = scanner.scan_skill("/path/to/skill")

print(f"Findings: {len(result.findings)}")
print(f"Max severity: {result.max_severity}")

# Note: is_safe indicates no HIGH/CRITICAL findings were detected.
# It does not guarantee the skill is free of all risk.
if not result.is_safe:
    print("Issues detected -- review findings before deployment")
```

## GitHub Actions

Scan skills automatically on every push or PR using the [reusable workflow](docs/github-actions.md):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/scan-skills.yml
name: Scan Skills
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: [".cursor/skills/**"]
jobs:
  scan:
    uses: cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner/.github/workflows/scan-skills.yml@main
    with:
      skill_path: .cursor/skills
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      contents: read
```

Results appear as inline annotations in PRs via GitHub Code Scanning. See the [full guide](docs/github-actions.md) for LLM integration, secret configuration, and branch protection setup.

---

## Pre-commit Hook

Scan skills before every commit using the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner
    rev: v1.0.0  # use the latest release tag
    hooks:
      - id: skill-scanner
```

Or install the built-in hook directly:

```bash
skill-scanner-pre-commit install
```

The hook automatically detects which skill directories have staged changes and only scans those, keeping commit times fast. Use `--all` to scan everything.
